                <p>This resume was coded using HTML5 
                    and CSS3. It was my first attempt 
                    coding with CSS grid for a fully 
                    responsive design. All buttons and 
                    links are in working condition. 
                    If you type a message and press the 
                    submit button, it will send me an e-mail. 
                    I used a Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, 
                    and JavaScript template from<a href="https://designdrastic.com/template/html5-responsive-cv-resume" target="_blank" class="">Design Drastic</a> to start the resume. 
                    All edits were made by myself using CSS and HTML5.
                    The cover letter was based on a CSS3 and HTML5 grid demonstration
                    produced by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3qBpPw77qo&t=425s" target="_blank">Traversy Media</a>.</p>

                            and styles to suit the customers needs. I am proficient in navigation. 
                            I also know many tricks with pictures, videos, and buttons to make 
                            a project stand out. <!--HTML5 has included many knew syntax commands that 
                            are very useful and get around a lot of what JavaScript used to do. Practice 
                            makes perfect and I practice HTML5 often. I'm never scared to try something new.-->

                            <p>CSS3 is a great way produce fully responsive websites. 
                            With CSS grid and media queries I am can design a website 
                            that will be responsive no matter the size of the screen. 
                            I can also create animations with amazing effects.</p>

                            HTML5 or CSS, I can still produce forms and queries. 
                            This allows me to connect the website to a database 
                            for data analysis. Login and registration forms help
                            a website keep track of it's customers.
